\textbf{[Exercise 6.2.6]} Consider the PDA $P$ from Exercise 6.1.1.

a) Convert $P$ to another PDA $P_1$, that accepts by the empty stack the same language
that $P$ accepts by the final state; i.e., $N(P_1)=L(P)$.

b) Find a PDA $P_2$ such that $L(P_2)=N(P)$; i.e., $P_2$ accepts by the final state
what $P$ accepts by empty stack.
