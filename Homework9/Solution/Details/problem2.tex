\textbf{[Exercise 8.3.2]} Design a Turing machine that takes as input
a number $N$ and adds 1 to it in binary. To be precise, the tape initially
contains a \$ followed by $N$ in binary. The tape head is initially scanning 
the leftmost symbol of $N+1$, in state $q_f$. You may destroy the \$ in creating
$N+1$, if necessary. For instance, $q_0\$10011\vdash^*q_f\$10100$, and 
$q_0\$11111\vdash^*q_f\$100000$.

a) Give the transitions of your Turing machine, and explain the purpose of 
each state.

b) Show the sequence of ID's of your TM when given input \$111.
