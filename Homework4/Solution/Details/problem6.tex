\textbf{思考题 [Exercise 4.2.3]} If $L$ is a language, and $a$ is a symbol, then 
$a\backslash L$ is the set of strings $w$ such that $aw$ is in $L$. For example, if 
$L=\{a,aab,baa\}$, then $a\backslash L = \{\epsilon,ab\}$. Prove that if $L$ is regular,
so is $a\backslash L$. \textit{Hint}: Remember that the regular language are closed 
under reversal and under the quotient operation of Exercise 4.2.2.
