\textbf{思考题[Exercise 2.2.6]} Give DFA's accepting the following languages 
over the alphabet $\{0,1\}$:\\
a) The set of all strings that beginning with a $1$ that, when interpreted
as a binary integer, is a multiple of $5$. For example, strings $101$, 
$1010$, and $1111$ are in the language; $0$, $100$, and $111$ are not.\\
b) The set of all strings that, when interpreted in reverse as a binary 
integer, is divisble by $5$. Examples of strings in the language are $0$, 
$10011$, $1001100$, and $0101$.
