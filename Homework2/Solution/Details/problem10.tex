\textbf{思考题[Exercise 4.2.3]} If $L$ is a language, and $a$ is a symbol, 
then $L/a$, the \textit{quotient} of $L$ and $a$, is the set of string $w$ 
such that $wa$ is in $L$. For example, if $L = \{a,aab,baa\}$, then 
$L/a = \{\epsilon,ba\}$. Prove that if $L$ is regular, so is $L/a$.\\
\textit{Hint}: Start with a DFA for $L$ and consider the set of accepting states.
