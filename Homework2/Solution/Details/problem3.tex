\textbf{[Exercise 2.3.4]} Give nondeterministic finite automata to accept the following
languages. Try to take advantage of nondeterminism as much as possible.\\
b) The set of strings over alphabet $\{0,1,\cdots,9\}$ such that the final digit has
\textit{not} appeared before.\\
c) The set of strings of $0$'s and $1$'s such that there are two $0$'s separated by a 
number of positions that is a multiple of 4. Note that $0$ is an allowable multiple of
4.
