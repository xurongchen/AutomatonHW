\textbf{[Exercise 5.1.5]} Let $T = \{0,1,(,),+,*,\emptyset,e\}$. We may
think of $T$ as the set of symbols used by regular expressions over
alphabet $\{0,1\}$; the only difference is that we use $e$ for symbols
$\epsilon$, to avoid potential confusion in what follows. Your task is 
to design a CFG with a set of terminals $T$ that generates exactly the
the regular expressions with alphabet $\{0,1\}$.
